                <p>We are excited to announce the establishment of the Econometrics Learning Lab (ELL) in the Department of Economics at Indiana University. The ELL aims to develop and disseminate innovative methodologies and econometric theories specifically designed for analyzing large-dimensional economic data.</p>
                
                <p>In today's data-rich environment, there is an urgent need for tools that can effectively handle complex datasets we encounter in economic applications, and the ELL is poised to meet this demand.</p>

                <p>The primary goal of the ELL is to equip faculty and graduate students with the necessary skills and knowledge to utilize machine learning tools for economic data analysis. The Lab offers a supportive environment where participants can learn various new methodologies while leveraging their theoretical backgrounds.</p>
